#Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews for Product Improvement
What This Project is About

In this project, we’re diving into the world of customer reviews from e-commerce sites.

The goal is simple: understand what customers are really saying about a product. By analyzing their feedback, we’ll be able to see what they love, what needs work, and how companies can make their products even better. Think of it as listening to customers on a deeper level, using data to uncover the emotions behind their words.

Why This Matters

When a product is launched on e-commerce platforms, the first wave of customer feedback is incredibly important. These reviews offer a glimpse into how well the product is being received. By analyzing these reviews, we can gather valuable insights into what customers think and feel. This helps businesses tweak and improve their products, making sure they’re meeting customer needs and expectations.

What We’ll Be Using:

Language: Python
Libraries:Textblob ,Numpy, Pandas ,Seaborn Wordcloud & Matplotlib
Data Source : Kaggle(Amazon Product Reviews).
Platform: Google Colab
What We Hope to Achieve

By the end of this project, we’ll have a clear picture of the sentiments behind customer reviews—whether they’re positive, negative, or somewhere in between. This will help us understand how customers really feel about a product and what can be done to improve their experience.
